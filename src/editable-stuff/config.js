In my role as the President of Kent Coding Club, I initiated and led a STEM outreach program where members taught local students programming and robotics using mBots. During weekdays, I assisted my peers to understand concepts easily in math/science as Peer Tutor. In addition, I proposed and implemented a demo chatbot application to make the peer tutor signup process much easier.",
